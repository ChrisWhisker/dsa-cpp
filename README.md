# LongLeaf Library: C++ Data Structures, Algorithms, and Design Patterns

This repository serves as a demonstration of implementations of common data structures, algorithms, and design patterns in C++. The primary focus is on memory efficiency and reducing dependencies on the C++ Standard Template Library (STL). By providing efficient solutions without relying heavily on the STL, this repository aims to offer insights into building robust and resource-conscious software systems.

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is twofold:

1. **Demonstrate Efficient Implementations:** The implementations showcased here prioritize memory efficiency and minimize reliance on the C++ STL. This approach is beneficial for environments with restricted standard library support or where manual memory management is preferred.

2. **Educational Resource:** Developers can use this repository as a learning resource to understand the inner workings of common data structures, algorithms, and design patterns in C++. By examining the code and studying the provided implementations, developers can enhance their understanding of fundamental concepts in computer science and software engineering.

## Key Features

- **Memory-Efficient Implementations:** The implementations emphasize efficient memory usage, making them suitable for resource-constrained environments or situations where manual memory management is desired.

- **Reduced Dependencies:** The codebase minimizes dependencies on the C++ STL, providing alternative solutions for scenarios where standard library support may be limited or unavailable.

- **Focus on Common Data Structures, Algorithms, and Design Patterns:** In addition to data structures and algorithms, this repository includes examples of common design pattern implementations, enriching the learning experience for developers.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository.
2. Explore the provided header files and source code to understand the implementations.
3. Integrate the desired data structures, algorithms, and design patterns into your projects as needed, ensuring compatibility with your specific requirements and constraints.
